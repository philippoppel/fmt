      "q1": "Is FindMyTherapy free?",
      "a1": "Yes, everything is free for you: matching, therapist search, and guides. Costs only arise directly with the therapist for therapy sessions – you can see these fees transparently in each profile.",
      "q2": "How does the matching work?",
      "a2": "You answer simple questions about your situation and preferences in about 5 minutes. Our system then finds the therapists that best match you – based on specialization, therapy style, and practical factors.",
      "q3": "How do I find the right therapist?",
      "a3": "We only show you verified therapists with real available capacity. You can filter by topic, location, format (online/in-person), and availability. Our matching helps you find not just any therapist, but the right one.",
      "q4": "Is my data secure?",
      "a4": "Yes. All data is encrypted and stored on EU servers in compliance with GDPR. You decide whether and with whom you share your results – no one sees your data without your permission.",
      "q5": "I need help immediately – what should I do?",
      "a5": "In an acute crisis, we immediately show you Austrian crisis hotlines (e.g., Telefonseelsorge 142) and emergency medical contacts. FindMyTherapy does not replace the emergency number 144 in emergencies."
